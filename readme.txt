To create a database backup file or a mysqldump, simply install our [free Database Backup plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/database-backup/). This plugin avoids extended inserts*, which complicate dump files with multiple-row syntax.
(*) Extended inserts include several (sometimes hundreds) VALUES lists per insert statement.

The Database Backup plugin also copies large database files to the BigDump restore folder, eliminating the need for an FTP application when restoring with BigDump, thus resolving challenges such as SQL restore hangs and restore failures on large datasets.

== Note ==
BigDump original script will fail processing large tables containing extended inserts (look above).


== Important: ==
When you restore, your current database will be erased and it is not possible undo that. Then, run a backup and download it to your local computer before proceed.

1) Install via wordpress.org

2) Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

or

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
